  maxBytes: 104857600 # 100MB default, 0 to disable

  # The number of bytes to claim as the maximum size for uploads for the limits API. If this
  # is not provided then the maxBytes setting will be used instead. This is useful to provide
  # if the media repo's settings and the reverse proxy do not match for maximum request size.
